# A+ Detailed Log — October 22, 2025

## Session Overview
Today's focus was on TypeScript normalization, ESM conversion, and monorepo cleanup. We stabilized `tsconfig` structures, corrected path resolution issues, and prepared the codebase for UI work.

---

### ✅ Key Accomplishments
- Repaired and aligned all `tsconfig.json` files across packages  
- Eliminated ghost errors from `loot-core`  
- Set up proper type declarations for `vite-plugin-peggy-loader`  
- Converted `sync-server` files from CommonJS → ESM syntax  
- Added Copilot troubleshooting prompts for future debugging  
- Fixed all relative `extends` and `baseUrl` configurations  
- Root `tsconfig.json` validated and stable  
- Project now builds through TypeScript with minimal blocking errors  

---

### 🧩 Outstanding Issues
- [ ] Complete remaining ESM conversions inside `sync-server`  
- [ ] Normalize all `vite` and `vitest` type references  
- [ ] Re-enable `"isolatedModules": true` once safe  
- [ ] Validate `express`, `cors`, `ipaddr.js` imports  
- [ ] Automate nightly commit summaries

### ⚙️ Identity / Continuity
**AI:** Kai  
- Honesty rule active (“Ok dumbass” mode)  
- Static checklist enforced — no automatic reordering  
- Incremental build testing at every session start

### 🗓 Tomorrow’s Plan — October 23, 2025
1. Full project compile scan:  
   ```bash
   npx tsc -b --verbose
   ```
2. Grade readiness across all packages (A+ eval)  
3. Confirm `sync-server` stability and cleanup any remaining TypeScript errors  
4. Begin UI migration readiness check  
5. Prepare environment for frontend optimization phase

### 🎯 Estimated UI Work Start
**~2–3 days away**, pending zero TypeScript errors and successful ESM integration in backend components.
