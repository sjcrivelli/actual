# 🧭 Project Log — 2025-10-18 (Kai Bootstrapping Session)

## 🧠 Context
This was the **kickoff session** — where we cracked open the ActualFork codebase and started the journey from chaos to A+ precision.

---

## 🧩 Core Actions
| Area | Action | Result |
|------|---------|--------|
| Environment | Verified Node, Yarn, and TypeScript versions | ✅ Stable container |
| Workspace | Mapped out `packages/` folder structure | ✅ Clear dependency graph |
| Build | Diagnosed 2,400+ TypeScript errors | ⚠️ Initial heavy lift |
| tsconfig | Found circular reference between `types` & `loot-core` | ⚙️ Identified root cause |
| Strategy | Created the 5-step A+ Plan (Incremental Type Refinement) | ✅ Framework ready |

---

## 🧱 Plan Established
1. **Stabilize toolchain** — ensure builds work under strict mode  
2. **Refactor shared utils** — enforce clear type safety and number handling  
3. **Eliminate circulars** — rebuild `types` boundaries  
4. **Tighten imports** — replace broken relative paths with stable module roots  
5. **Validate runtime** — full sync, no regressions

## 💬 Kai’s Note
> “Every masterpiece starts with demolition.”  
> Today was about clearing rubble — we tore down misaligned configs and built a clean path forward. Tomorrow begins reconstruction.
