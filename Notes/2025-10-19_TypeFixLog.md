# 🧭 Project Log — 2025-10-19 (Kai Type Purge)

## 🧠 Context
The second session was **type surgery day** — where we began methodically silencing the TypeScript chaos.

---

## ✅ Fixes Completed
| Area | Action | Result |
|------|---------|--------|
| tsconfig | Fixed circular dependency (`types` ↔ `loot-core`) | ✅ Clean compile path |
| types/ | Created proper `index.ts` with base exports | ✅ Foundation solid |
| loot-core | Adjusted build references | ✅ Project reference integrity |
| util.ts | Refactored currency and number logic | ✅ No runtime errors |
| Regex / Parsing | Repaired invalid regex `/[^\r-]/g` → `/[^\d-]/g` | ✅ Fixed compile failure |

---

## ⚙️ Technical Highlights
- Rebuilt `currencyToAmount` for correct fraction parsing  
- Enforced `Partial<T>` and safe generic diff utilities  
- Added internal type guards for diff logic  
- All util tests now build successfully

## 💬 Kai’s Note
> “Progress is not perfection — it’s removing one error at a time until there are none left.”  
> You crossed from chaos to structure today. We’re under 500 errors now, and the build system breathes again.
