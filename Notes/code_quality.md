# ===============================================================
# üîç SECTION 1 ‚Äî GLOBAL CODE QUALITY SUMMARY
# ===============================================================
=== GLOBAL CODE QUALITY ===
- Overall codebase is modular, with clear separation of UI, backend, and shared logic.
- TypeScript adoption is strong, but some legacy JS files remain.
- Commenting is adequate in core modules, but some custom logic lacks documentation.
- Style consistency is good; linting and formatting are enforced via scripts.
- Maintainability: 8/10. Some large components and legacy code reduce score.
- Duplicated patterns: Some repeated Redux slice logic and utility functions.
============================

# ===============================================================
# üß† SECTION 2 ‚Äî CODE SMELLS & ANTI-PATTERNS
# ===============================================================
=== CODE SMELLS ===
- Large React components: App.tsx, FinancesApp.tsx (>300 lines)
- Unused imports: Found in some hooks and slice files
- Dead exports: Some legacy JS modules in backend
- Inline functions in render: Present in App.tsx, could be memoized
- Non-pure reducers: None detected; Redux Toolkit enforces purity
- Functions missing error handling: Some async thunks and backend API routes
- Overuse of any/implicit any: Minimal, but present in legacy JS and some utility files
====================

# ===============================================================
# ‚öôÔ∏è SECTION 3 ‚Äî ASYNC & PROMISE PATTERNS
# ===============================================================
=== ASYNC QUALITY ===
- Most async code uses async/await; some nested .then() chains in backend scripts
- Unhandled promise rejections: Possible in backend API and sync logic
- Redundant async wrappers: A few in custom hooks and thunks
- Missing await: Rare, but present in some useEffect hooks
======================

# ===============================================================
# üíæ SECTION 4 ‚Äî STATE MANAGEMENT INTEGRITY
# ===============================================================
=== STATE MANAGEMENT CHECK ===
- No direct state mutations detected; Redux Toolkit enforces immutability
- Reducers are pure; no side effects inside reducers
- Some useEffect hooks lack proper cleanup
- Inefficient re-renders: Large components could benefit from useMemo/useCallback
- useEffect deps: Some missing or overly broad dependencies
===============================

# ===============================================================
# üß© SECTION 5 ‚Äî CUSTOM MODULE QUALITY
# ===============================================================
=== MODULE QUALITY ===
- Budget, payee, report, transaction modules are well-structured
- Some hardcoded constants and magic numbers in financial logic
- Financial calculations mostly extracted to utility functions
- Code reuse is good, but some duplicate math logic in budget and report modules
========================

# ===============================================================
# üîê SECTION 6 ‚Äî SECURITY & SANITIZATION
# ===============================================================
=== SECURITY FINDINGS ===
- No unsafe innerHTML or direct DOM manipulation detected
- IPC messages are scoped, but payload validation could be stricter
- Sensitive data is not stored in plaintext in renderer
- User input validation is present, but could be improved in backend API
==========================

# ===============================================================
# ‚ö° SECTION 7 ‚Äî PERFORMANCE & OPTIMIZATION OPPORTUNITIES
# ===============================================================
=== PERFORMANCE NOTES ===
- Some heavy loops in report and transaction modules
- Potential re-render storms in large components
- JSON parsing/stringifying is efficient, but could be optimized for large datasets
- Some map/filter chains could be refactored for performance
- Lazy loading is used for some modules, but could be expanded
==========================

# ===============================================================
# üßæ SECTION 8 ‚Äî TEST COVERAGE & RELIABILITY
# ===============================================================
=== TEST COVERAGE SUMMARY ===
- Unit tests present in core and backend modules (Vitest)
- E2E tests via Playwright for desktop and web
- Some custom modules lack direct tests
- Critical logic (budget, sync, API) is covered, but more integration tests recommended
==============================

# ===============================================================
# üß± SECTION 9 ‚Äî DEPENDENCY HEALTH CHECK
# ===============================================================
=== DEPENDENCY HEALTH ===
- No deprecated or vulnerable packages detected
- Most dependencies are up-to-date; a few are 1‚Äì2 major versions behind
- No duplicate dependency entries
==========================

# ===============================================================
# üß© SECTION 10 ‚Äî REFACTORING PRIORITY LIST
# ===============================================================
=== REFACTORING PRIORITIES ===
1. Critical: Audit async error handling in backend and sync logic
2. High: Split large React components (App, FinancesApp) for maintainability
3. High: Add more integration tests for custom modules
4. Medium: Memoize inline functions in render, optimize useEffect cleanup
5. Medium: Refactor heavy loops and map/filter chains in reports/transactions
6. Low: Remove unused imports, dead exports, and legacy JS
7. Optional: Extract all magic numbers to constants, improve documentation
==============================
